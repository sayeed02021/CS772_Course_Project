# CS772_Course_Project

Codes for the course project which is based on the paper:  Dream the Impossible: Outlier Imagination with Diffusion Models by Xuefeng Du, Yiyou Sun, Xiaojin Zhu, and Yixuan Li


## Instructions for running
- Currently much of the parameters are hard coded so we that the parameters and the file names cannot be changed
- Go to scripts folder and run python3 pre_train_cifar.py
- Next if you want to evaluate your model run python3 evaluate.py
- To visualize TSNE plot run python3 t_SNE.py
- To generate out of distribution embeddings run python3 sampler.py
- To get pixel space images run python3 stable_diffusion_gen.py
